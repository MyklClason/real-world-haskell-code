This is my repo for Real World Haskell.
While an older book, it seemed like a good place to start learning Haskell.

This repo may include some small Haskell side projects.
Larger Haskell projects will get their own repo.

Commits will be to the master branch as I'll be mostly committing every every chapter.
And there isn't much need to create seperate branches that'll just have one commit.

- Code from the course will be in the "ch##" folders.
- Haskell install script (not mine) is in the "install" folder
- Any code I'll create will be in the "projects" folder, if there is any.
